# or-covid-tracker
This project is a county level COVID-19/Coronavirus tracker for the State of Oregon, built using d3.js and Bootstrap (for CSS).

Data is retrieved daily from OHA's web site [here](https://govstatus.egov.com/OR-OHA-COVID-19).

The current version requires data to be manually updated - in the future I will build some data pipelines to automate this process.

Thanks to:
* The bubble map example [here](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/bubble-map/), which I used as a starting point/template.
* The TopoJSON map of Oregon available [here](https://github.com/deldersveld/topojson/blob/master/countries/us-states/OR-41-oregon-counties.json).
